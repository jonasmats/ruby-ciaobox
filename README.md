The idea is a simple, on-demand cloud-storage solution. Our customers never have to visit a storage facility.
Our Team Members delivers high quality plastic green bins to a customer's home, which they then fill, with whatever they want to store.

We aren't limited to the bins though-- we are happy to store other items including bicycles or oversized items that fit into one of our oversized boxes (as long as one person can carry it) Our team returns and transports the customer's bins to our secure storage facility until they decide they want them back. 

In the mayor part of Switzerland, where we cannot serve directly our customers, we will use our service “CiaoBox Fly”where we will send trough Express Courier Empty Cardboard Boxes. Customers can choose the Picking date and our Courier will deliver us their stuff. Our Team will care their things until they decide to take back the boxes.

Customers can see what they have in storage on our website or mobile app and include pictures of what is inside the bin for easy retrieval. 
Customer's belongings can be returned to them in as little as 24 hours for a small fee.
